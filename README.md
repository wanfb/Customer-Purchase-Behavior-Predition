[2017 Data Mining Cup Challenge](https://www.data-mining-cup.com/reviews/dmc-2017/) - Revenue Forecast as a foundation for dynamic pricing.

### Background
Real-time automated price generation moves into focus for online retailers. Every day, category management faces the challenge of adapting thousands of products to changing market factors. This happens completely automatically when using an intelligent pricing tool. Prices reflect customer appreciation and lead to increased sales.
